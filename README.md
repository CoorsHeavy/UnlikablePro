# UnlikablePro
Use Instagram without liking posts.
Have you ever gone through your crushes Instagram account? Have you ever accidentally hit "like" on her/his old post? Have you ever been paranoid about doing this and looking like the creep that you are. If your answer to any of these questions is yes then Unlikable is the app for you. Unlikable is a browser that opens the Instagram website but removes the "like" option. Double tapping a post will not do any thing because that U.I. element has been removed from the website's code along with the heart button. Other than the removal of the ability to like posts this Instagram browser is identical to the one you know and love.

Known Bugs: The top left menu button is operational but could be more responsive.
Since launching this app Instagram has updated their websites code. So I need to make changes that will allow the app to continue to correctly parse the websites HTML.
